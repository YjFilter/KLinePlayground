# Current Project State

## Active Milestone
Phase 2 - Aggregation and replay-clock core is complete on `feature/phase2-replay-clock` and awaiting integration approval.

## Completed Foundation
- Multi-agent collaboration control plane and quality profiles.
- BaoStock-backed five-year normalized 30-minute source, validation, cache, and synchronization.
- `ReplayPeriod` contracts for `30m`, `4h_session`, `daily`, and `weekly`.
- Revealed-only aggregation with partial-candle completion state and no future OHLCV leakage.
- Replay clock using actual base timestamps for lunch, weekends, holidays, suspensions, short weeks, and incomplete sessions.
- Pure advance plans containing each underlying 30-minute timestamp in `(current_time, target_time]`.

## Phase 2 Verification
- Aggregator tests: 8 passed.
- Replay-clock tests: 11 passed.
- Independent no-future-leakage tests: 6 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_gate.py phase2`: passed, 25 focused tests.
- Full quality profile passed after integration.

## Multi-Agent Outcome
- One Agent implemented and tested aggregation.
- One Agent implemented and tested the replay clock.
- One independent Agent wrote black-box future-leakage tests.
- Codex fixed public contracts, integrated outputs, extended quality gates, and performed final review.

## Scope Boundary
Phase 2 intentionally does not modify `KLineProcessorEnhanced`, Flask routes, trading execution, frontend, reports, or persistence. Those components will consume these stable boundaries in Phases 3 and 4.

## Known Limitation
BaoStock does not provide Beijing Exchange 30-minute data. A fallback source or import path remains required for prefixes `43`, `83`, `87`, and `92`.

## Next Action
Integrate Phase 2, then begin Phase 3 trading-engine adaptation: full trade timestamps, previous-trading-day close, and sequential hidden-bar order processing.
