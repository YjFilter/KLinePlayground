# Current Project State

## Active Milestone
Phase 4 - API and frontend integration is complete; TASK-014 passed final no-patch browser acceptance.

## Completed Foundation
- Multi-agent collaboration control plane and quality profiles.
- BaoStock-backed five-year normalized 30-minute source, validation, cache, and synchronization.
- `ReplayPeriod` contracts for `30m`, `4h_session`, `daily`, and `weekly`.
- Revealed-only aggregation with partial-candle completion state and no future OHLCV leakage.
- Replay clock using actual base timestamps for lunch, weekends, holidays, suspensions, short weeks, and incomplete sessions.
- Pure advance plans containing each underlying 30-minute timestamp in `(current_time, target_time]`.

## Phase 2 Verification
- Aggregator tests: 8 passed.
- Replay-clock tests: 11 passed.
- Independent no-future-leakage tests: 6 passed.
- `python scripts/quality_gate.py phase2`: passed, 25 focused tests.
- Full quality profile passed after integration.

## Multi-Agent Outcome
- One Agent implemented and tested aggregation.
- One Agent implemented and tested the replay clock.
- One independent Agent wrote black-box future-leakage tests.
- Codex fixed public contracts, integrated outputs, extended quality gates, and performed final review.

## Scope Boundary
Phase 2 intentionally does not modify `KLineProcessorEnhanced`, Flask routes, trading execution, frontend, reports, or persistence. Those components will consume these stable boundaries in Phases 3 and 4.

## Known Limitation
BaoStock does not provide Beijing Exchange 30-minute data. A fallback source or import path remains required for prefixes `43`, `83`, `87`, and `92`.

## Phase 3 Completed
- Previous effective trading-day close lookup.
- Sequential hidden-base-bar execution with explicit replay-clock commit.
- Full trade timestamps and display-period metadata with additive SQLite migration.
- Critical trading adapter joining replay plans, prices, previous close, orders, and simulator.
- Independent daily-large-step versus repeated-30m equivalence verification.

## Phase 4 Completed
- `TASK-010`: intraday replay session controller accepted.
- `TASK-011`: four-period static HTML/CSS controls accepted.
- `TASK-012`: Flask API integration accepted; 65 focused API tests and the full 275-test suite passed.
- `TASK-013`: frontend JavaScript integration accepted; 33 focused static tests and the full 308-test suite passed.
- `TASK-014`: final no-patch browser/API acceptance passed with 9 Pass / 0 Fail / 0 Blocked.
- Fresh intraday session evidence: Console errors 0, HTTP 4xx 0, HTTP 5xx 0, `/next` max concurrency 1, stale replay plan 0, and no post-pause `/next` requests.
- The original TASK-014 FAIL evidence remains preserved; the latest report section records the passing retest after commit `33ab2a2`.

## Known Legacy Issue
- Legacy blind-box daily mode can log `加载技术指标失败: Value is undefined`; it is isolated from the intraday path and is non-blocking for Phase 4.

## Next Action
Select the next roadmap milestone or publish the completed Phase 4 commit series to the remote repository.

## Phase 5 Started
- Approved specification: historical context, trading-day limits, bidirectional completed-review loading, and intraday blind-box selection.
- TASK-015 completed the immutable distinct-trading-day replay cutoff contract.
- TASK-016 completed active/completed read-only chart windows for all four replay periods with a server-side no-future cap.
- TASK-017 completed bounded-retry intraday blind-box selection with BSE exclusion, two-year context checks, and injectable randomness.
- TASK-018 completed the static historical-window toolbar, one-year loading controls, and actual-trading-day setup wording.
- Codex reviewed the six worker-owned files, added stable package exports, and passed 307 intraday tests plus 13 subtests.
- Codex owns public exports, Flask hotspot integration, persistence contracts, quality gates, and final acceptance.

## Phase 5 Next Action
Integrate the Phase 5 contracts into Flask and stored session metadata, then wire the accepted TASK-018 controls to the committed API contract.
